# 👋 Orlando Del Valle Sanchez  
**Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional | IT Consultant | Holberton School Student in Puerto Rico**

🔐 **Cybersecurity Focus:**  
I’m passionate about cybersecurity, with hands-on experience in IT operations, technical support, and vulnerability assessment. Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in areas like SOC implementation, honeynet deployment, and penetration testing as I work toward becoming a skilled penetration tester. I hold the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, CompTIA A+, and Cisco's Introduction to Cyber Security certifications. I’m also working on earning the CompTIA Security+ certification to further strengthen my knowledge base.

💻 **Tech Stack:**  
I am experienced with tools like VirtualBox, Microsoft Office Suite, Azure, and various SIEM systems. In addition to core IT support skills, I’m learning languages and tools like Python, SQL, and Bash to enhance my cybersecurity capabilities.

📂 **Projects:**  
- **SOC and Honeynet Deployment on Azure** - Building a Security Operations Center in Azure to monitor and log cyber threats as a portfolio project.
- **Bug Bounty Work** - Actively participating in bug bounty programs, applying ethical hacking techniques to discover and report vulnerabilities.
- **C Projects** - Working on low-level programming projects that follow strict coding standards to improve security practices and memory management.

🎯 **Future Goals:**  
I’m working toward obtaining my OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certification to deepen my penetration testing skills and achieve my ultimate goal of becoming a security analyst focused on threat detection and mitigation.

🌐 **Beyond Code:**  
When I’m not working on cybersecurity, I’m probably gaming, exploring new tech, or listening to cybersecurity podcasts like *CyberWire Daily* and *Darknet Diaries*.
